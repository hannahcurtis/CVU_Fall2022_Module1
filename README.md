My name is Hannah Curtis, and I’m a first-year Master’s Student in environmental engineering at UW-Madison working in the hydroecology lab.
My research focuses on how green infrastructure affects urban ponds and the Yahara Watershed as a whole.
My goals for this modules include:

1. Learn how to use version control software to organize my research data.
2. Gain more practice coding in Python, specifically in an engineering/research setting.
3. Learn how to organize coding files with Jupyter Notebooks.
4. Connect with students from other universities with similar interests.
